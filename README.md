# Pair-Matching-Sum
# Description:
Find Pairs by Sum is a Java-based program designed to identify all unique pairs of numbers in a given list that add up to a specified target value. This project demonstrates efficient use of data structures such as HashSet to optimize pair-matching algorithms.

# Features:
Accepts a list of integers and a target sum as input.
Outputs all pairs of numbers that sum up to the target.
Efficient implementation with a time complexity of O(n).
Handles both positive and negative numbers seamlessly.
Includes user-friendly console input and output.

# Use Case:
This program is perfect for solving problems related to:
Pair-matching in datasets.
Learning and demonstrating efficient algorithms in Java.
Quick implementation of sum-based filtering logic.

Feel free to fork, modify, and explore different enhancements for the project!
